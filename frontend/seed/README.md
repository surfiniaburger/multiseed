# Project Overview:
Multiseed is a decentralized multi-signature (MultiSig) wallet built on Ethereum using Arbitrum stylus rust contracts. It allows multiple users to collectively manage and secure digital assets, requiring multiple approvals (signatures) before any transaction can be executed. This increases security by preventing a single point of failure in asset management.

## Problem Statement:
Traditional financial systems often rely on centralized authorities or single-user control over funds, which poses a significant risk of mismanagement, hacking, or fraud. For organizations, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), charities, or even friends managing shared assets, securing funds with multiple layers of approval can prevent unauthorized transactions.

For example, imagine a DAO managing millions of dollars in community funds, or a startup’s treasury that requires transparency and accountability. A single key holder could steal or misuse funds if there’s no oversight mechanism.

## Solution: Multiseed
SecureFund addresses this challenge by implementing a smart contract-based MultiSig wallet, where a minimum number of authorized signers must approve any transaction before it is executed. This provides a decentralized and trustless way of ensuring fund security while still allowing collaboration among multiple parties.

## Key Features:
Multiple Owners: SecureFund allows multiple owners (e.g., 3 out of 5) to manage a wallet. A transaction can only be approved if a predefined number of owners confirm it.

## Transaction Approval Workflow:

One owner can initiate a transaction, such as sending funds or making a payment.
The transaction will be in a pending state until the required number of approvals is met.
Other signers will be notified and must approve the transaction via a user interface before it is executed.
## Enhanced Security:

Non-executed transactions remain pending, so no unauthorized fund transfer can occur without the agreed number of signatures.
Funds cannot be accessed by a single party even if one wallet is compromised.
## Event Notifications:

Each transaction initiation triggers an event, notifying all other wallet signers via email, app notifications, or blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan).
